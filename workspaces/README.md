# Overview

### About Typesense

Typesense is an open-source, typo-tolerant search engine optimized for instant (typically sub-50ms) search-as-you-type experiences and developer productivity.

If you've heard about ElasticSearch or Algolia, a good way to think about Typesense is that it is:
- An open source alternative to Algolia, with some key quirks solved and
- An easier-to-use batteries-included alternative to ElasticSearch
